# tyler dashboard

I have a home file server/media player/compute node used by the whole family. Sometimes I'm not available to perform maintenance tasks on it. This is a small dashboard to allow normal people to do maintenance tasks.

* Restart Kodi

## TODO

* Is the Internet working?
* Are there any alerts (e.g. disk failures)
